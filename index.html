                <h3>Purrfect Paw Placement</h3>
                <p>The "Purr-fect Paw Placement" project is an innovative Pet Adoption System designed to improve the welfare of stray animals in Turkey. Our centralized platform connects shelters with potential adopters, streamlining the registration, profiling, and adoption application processes. This system not only enhances shelter operations but also improves the overall adoption experience for users. By reducing the number of stray animals and increasing successful adoptions, we hope to foster a compassionate attitude towards stray animals in our society.</p>
